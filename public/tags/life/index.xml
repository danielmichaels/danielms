      <description>Starting Your Side Hustle This is a collection of notes from one of the world&amp;rsquo;s expert Side Hustlers, Chris Guillebeau. If you have not read his book The $100 Startup, you really should. It also includes important takeaways from other bloggers and authors. Wherever applicable references have been added.
Its also pretty important to define a side hustle. We are talking about small enterprises which take little to no time for setup, maintenance and daily running.</description>
