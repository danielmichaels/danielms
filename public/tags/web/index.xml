      <description>Curl Today I learnt that Curl can also be used to send emails. One of my projects is to manage a fleet of embedded devices that communicate information back to our servers. Email is one part of this process. And, curl is installed on these devices, greatly simplifying things.
Syntax # gmail specific curl --url &amp;#39;smtps://smtp.gmail.com:587&amp;#39; --ssl-reqd \ --mail-from &amp;#39;username@gmail.com&amp;#39; --mail-rcpt &amp;#39;rcpt@email.com&amp;#39; \ --user &amp;#39;username@gmail.com:password&amp;#39; --insecure \ --upload-file fileToBeUploaded.txt Let&amp;rsquo;s break down each component:</description>

      <description>HTTP 101 Prefetch What happens when you type an address into the search bar and hit enter:
 The browser extracts the domain name from the search bar. The users Domain Name System (DNS) cache is queried. If no previous entries are found a DNS request is sent via your configured DNS server. After getting the IP address via DNS, the host will initiate a TCP connection with that address. If the connection is successful, a response will be sent from the server and its data will be rendered using HTTP.</description>

      <description>HTTP Basics HTTP is an application level message based model where the client sends a request and the server returns a response. HTTP uses a stateful protocol - TCP - but is stateless, where each request is connectionless avoiding the need for servers to hold an open connection.
HTTP Requests The first line of every HTTP request has three (3) items, separated by spaces:
 The verb - GET,PUT,DELETE,POST,TRACE,CONNECT,OPTIONS, or HEAD The requested URL, typically the name of the resource plus an optional query string.</description>
