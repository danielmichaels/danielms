      <description>User agents What Every browser sends with its request, a string that says who it is. That string will contain information on its application type, operating system, and software version currently in use.
Heres mine: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:66.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/66.0 but it could just as easily be Mozilla/5.0 (PlayStation 4 4.71) AppleWebKit/601.2 (KHTML, like Gecko).
If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever been surfing the net on your mobile and selected &amp;ldquo;Request Desktop Site&amp;rdquo; then you have changed your phone browsers user agent.</description>

      <title>LessPass: A Primer</title>
      <link>https://danielms.site/blog/lesspass-eli5/</link>

      <description>LessPass The manager-less password manager LessPass, unlike other password managers does not store any information in a database or local cache. It simply takes in three pieces of information and then hashes that to return a password. If all three pieces of information haven&amp;rsquo;t changed LessPass will always return the same password.
Why use it over other choices Straight from the creator himself:

      <title>On teaching</title>

      <description>on teaching Recently it has befallen upon me to tutor my peers in programming concepts and fundamentals. It struck me that I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to properly impart my knowledge. Where do I start, with strings, or variables. When do I talk about types and equality. Is it better to teach while or for loops first? Classes, OOP, recursion, comprehensions, async! What is important now versus what is the minimum necessary to give them the basics required to go away and learn on their own.</description>

      <description>Python: strings and bytes Python 3 is the new python, and python 2 should be regarded as legacy. But, it is still being used heavily and will likely live beyond its end of life. Recently, a project forced me to use python 2.7 within a Centos environment and I hit some small encoding issues.
Character Sequences In python there are two types that represent sequences of characters:

      <title>Sqlite3: A Primer</title>

      <description>SQL Reference SQLite3 Specific Transactions SQLite transactions are ACID (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated and Durable). This means that data is not lost in the event of crashes, power failures or operating system dumps.
Atomic - Meaning changes cannot be broken down into smaller parts; either the entire transaction is commit or nothing at all.
Consistent - A transaction must ensure to change the database from one valid state to another. If a transaction results in invalid data, the database will revert its previous state.</description>

      <description>Environment Variables Simply put, environment variables are a collection of key value strings held by the current shell or process. Each process has access to an array of environment variables held in its user-space memory.
The environment variables are available to all applications, and allow these programs or scripts use them within the shell environment. They can allow custom modification to defaults that permeate throughout the user-space rather than be homed within each applications configuration.</description>

      <title>Python Object References</title>

      <description>Python Object Reference ELI5 I first learnt about variables through the analogy of &amp;ldquo;variables are boxes&amp;rdquo; and that we assign things to those boxes Turns out, this isn&amp;rsquo;t particularly helpful in objected orientated programming. This post is about how python treats object assignment and some of the hidden gotcha&amp;rsquo;s that can cause unintended errors along the way. Instead of &amp;ldquo;boxes&amp;rdquo; it is better to think of variables as &amp;ldquo;labels&amp;rdquo; that we attach to objects.</description>

      <description>Public Key Cryptography My simplest explanation TL;DR: Public key cryptography is a method of using a different key for the encryption and decryption of a file, message or other medium.
Public Key Cryptography What problem does it solve?
If two parties wish to exchange information to one another but the medium which they use to communicate is compromised, how do they share a secret key to unlock their encrypted messages?</description>

      <description>Base64 Base64 is a common encoding scheme. But what is it, why 64 bits and how does it work?
TL;DR  Base64 is a binary to ASCII encoding that takes a byte (8 bits) and chunks its down into segments of 6 bits - six ones in binary equates to 64 which is where it derives its name.
 first, a demo Let&amp;rsquo;s look at an example using the three letter word &amp;ldquo;The&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Flask, Forms and HTTP Requests Preface This week I have been building a small webapp that leverage&amp;rsquo;s an external API to populate values in the user pages. And it pains me to say that I spent a silly length of time debugging what was a rather easy problem.
The webapp uses Flask, jinja2 templates and the fuelwatcher API. The issue started when trying to institute a search bar that allows the user to select a series of parameters.</description>

      <description>UPDATE 27/01/2019: This area of python and the PyPI is under going rapid development and as such the following may have parts which are no longer in date. In time I will update this post to reflect these changes.
Python Package Index Python has a wonderful community and package ecosystem. It currently has over 130,000 packages for download and a large variety to choose from. To download a python package via the pip command, the package must be uploaded to the Python Package Index, or PyPI.</description>

      <description>CoderDojo Today I volunteered my time at a local CoderDojo as a Mentor. The basic premise of a CoderDojo is it&amp;rsquo;s a place where children between 7 and 17 can learn programming, robotics or basically any technology that might inspire them. The kids are called &amp;lsquo;ninjas&amp;rsquo; whilst the program co-ordinators are known as champions, and people who help out in their area of expertise are the mentors.

      <description>Network Time Protocol So today I watched a talk on NTP and it was amazing. I will do my best to summarise the core parts in this post.
What is it? Network Time Protocol allows clocks between computers to be synchronised over the internet or local area network. It was developed by David L. Mills in 1985 and is currently in its fourth version. Accurate to a few milliseconds of Coordinated Universal Time, NTP is a fundamental instrument in modern networking.</description>

      <description>SSH Definition Straight from the man pages:
SSH (SSH client) is a program for logging into a remote machine and for executing commands on a remote machine. It is intended to provide secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections, arbitrary TCP ports and UNIX-domain sockets can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
Setup (Old School Method) On a new machine we need to setup up ssh.</description>

      <description>This is a short primer on the most simple of rsync&amp;rsquo;s capabilities.
Rsync is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file copying tool. It uses a delta transfer algorithm, which reduces the amount of data sent over the network by sending only the differences between the source and destination files. It can contact remote systems via SSH or through a rsync daemon over TCP.
Basic Syntax -r: The &amp;lsquo;r&amp;rsquo; flag denotes that the operation is recursive.</description>

      <description>WHH - Chapter 3 - Web App Technologies this will be primer of many of the underlying technologies that power the web and associated technologies.
The HTTP Protocol BLUF: Message based model where the client sends a request and the server retruns a response. HTTP uses a stateful protocl - TCP - but is stateless, where each request is autonomous and may use a different TCP connection.
HTTP Requests The first line of every HTTP request has three (3) items, separated by spaces:</description>
