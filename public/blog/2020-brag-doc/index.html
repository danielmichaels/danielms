<p>A reminder to yourself to review what you&rsquo;ve done this year. Catalogue your wins and reinforce <em>good</em> behaviour.</p>
<h2 id="2020-in-review">2020 In Review</h2>
<p>Here is what I have to brag about in 2020 so far:</p>
<p>Technologies:</p>
<p>I have developed, integrated or otherwise taken the following technologies beyond &ldquo;beginner&rdquo;, or enhanced these skills with the following examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Angular</p>
<ul>
<li>Gone from knowing zero Angular to being the lead  (sole) developer UI developer in a complex microservices application.</li>
<li>Lead the UI redesign including initial mock up and wireframes</li>
<li>Produced the scope of work within sprints</li>
<li>On boarded another UI developer and helped other experienced member re familiarise themselves with the code base</li>
<li>Deployed the redesign to production</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vue.js</p>
<ul>
<li>Built two separate web application with vue, both using Typescript</li>
<li>Both integrated into Python application backend&rsquo;s using <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ansible</p>
<ul>
<li>Identified that creating the infrastructure for deployments is tedious, error prone and not easily repeatable made learning ansible a high priority.</li>
<li>Successfully created a playbook to create a consistent deploy environment for side projects;
<ul>
<li>update server security and packages</li>
<li>install load balancer</li>
<li>ensure small servers have sufficient swap space (to compile javascript)</li>
<li>git operations on private and public repositories</li>
<li>encrypt secrets using vault</li>
<li>development with Vagrant and live instances</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flask</p>
<ul>
<li>Developed a bespoke application which could interface with other custom devices on a large network</li>
<li>Utilised plain javascript and server side rendered templates to create a UX that users found more familiar than the tool it replaced</li>
<li>Integrated stripe into Flask</li>
<li>Used a third party websockets service to facilitate realtime chat between users</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>FastAPI</p>
<ul>
<li>Deployed two application with the framework, replacing it with Flask in one instance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Docker (and swarm)</p>
<ul>
<li>Went from having a rudimentary understanding to being able to create detailed docker-compose files and deploy to a swarm</li>
<li>Now use docker as my development environment</li>
<li>All side projects have been ported to swarm with load balancing and HTTPS included</li>
<li>Utilised kubernetes for a short notice project and learnt the basics of the platform</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leadership
<ul>
<li>Lead the UI design and implementation after being assigned to short staffed, over worked close knit team on a complex microservice architecture.</li>
<li>Integrated well with the team and was able to provide subject matter expertise in Angular within a short period of time</li>
<li>Became the lead developer of another project requiring the integration of two systems (both in python) requiring facilitation of planning and design sessions between the teams</li>
<li>Speaking role in presentations selling our new product to senior management, including live demonstration of our MVP</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Design
<ul>
<li>High-level planning sessions for the integration of two platforms</li>
<li>Mock up and wireframing the UI for another team&rsquo;s platform</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CI/CD
<ul>
<li>From being relatively inexperienced in CI/CD to developing pipelines for projects ranging from established to newly created</li>
<li>Learnt how to establish shell and docker runners in using Gitlab and AWS</li>
<li>Created segregated pipelines for separate deploys based on tags</li>
<li>Successfully integrated Github actions in all side project web applications, including deployment of containers to docker swarm</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bash | Shell scripting
<ul>
<li>Took over established and complicated deployment shell scripts for production assets</li>
<li>Learnt a lot about debugging leading to the identification of several fixes resulting in the eradication of pipelines passing when they should have failed</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Accomplishments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deployed <a href="https://lic-investing.online">lic-investing.online</a>
<ul>
<li>An Australian financial web application which visually shows whether certain stocks are trading at a premium or discount.</li>
<li>Uses FastAPI and Vue.js</li>
<li>Scrapes web resources using various techniques to gather the data, this includes punting that raw data into Postgres.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deployed <a href="https://check-redirects.com">check-redirects.com</a>
<ul>
<li>Provides a service for tracing the redirection chain of a URL including status codes and response headers.</li>
<li>Includes an API for third parties</li>
<li>Built using FastAPI and Vue.js</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Replaced a rotting internal legacy tool with a web application:
<ul>
<li>Took an internal tool which was not being actively maintained and replaced it with Flask.
<ul>
<li>The tool needed to be either fixed or replaced to meet a looming deadline and our team was assigned to aid in unblocking the task</li>
<li>I first attempted to learn the code base and improve upon the design, however there were several critical issues which were cost prohibitive</li>
<li>After proposing a porting of the tool into a web application the design, implementation and handover of the task was completed in four weeks</li>
<li>This lead to the successful redeployment of a much needed tool, ultimately saving future development resources by rewriting it with a framework almost all developers in the organisation are familiar with.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After writing all this, its plain to see that I <em>have</em> achieved more than I realised.</p>
<p>The value in taking the time to write out what you have achieved over a period of time cannot be under estimated.</p>
<p>I did this in one sitting, unrefined and (mostly) unedited. This is for you to look back on and polish later <strong>when you need it</strong>.</p>
