      <description>Long live requests welcome HTTPX  HTTPX is a fully featured HTTP client for Python 3, which provides sync and async APIs, and support for both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.
 Far and away, requests stands as the most notable third party package. It&amp;rsquo;s almost considered part of what makes up python these days. Unfortunately, little forward progress has been made in recent times to incorporate python&amp;rsquo;s async capabilities.
This is where HTTPX is stepping up to the plate.</description>

      <description>HTTP 101 Prefetch What happens when you type an address into the search bar and hit enter:
 The browser extracts the domain name from the search bar. The users Domain Name System (DNS) cache is queried. If no previous entries are found a DNS request is sent via your configured DNS server. After getting the IP address via DNS, the host will initiate a TCP connection with that address. If the connection is successful, a response will be sent from the server and its data will be rendered using HTTP.</description>

      <description>HTTP Basics HTTP is an application level message based model where the client sends a request and the server returns a response. HTTP uses a stateful protocol - TCP - but is stateless, where each request is connectionless avoiding the need for servers to hold an open connection.
HTTP Requests The first line of every HTTP request has three (3) items, separated by spaces:
 The verb - GET,PUT,DELETE,POST,TRACE,CONNECT,OPTIONS, or HEAD The requested URL, typically the name of the resource plus an optional query string.</description>
