      <description>HTTP Basics HTTP is an application level message based model where the client sends a request and the server returns a response. HTTP uses a stateful protocol - TCP - but is stateless, where each request is connectionless avoiding the need for servers to hold an open connection.
HTTP Requests The first line of every HTTP request has three (3) items, separated by spaces:
 The verb - GET,PUT,DELETE,POST,TRACE,CONNECT,OPTIONS, or HEAD The requested URL, typically the name of the resource plus an optional query string.</description>

      <description>User agents What Every browser sends with its request, a string that says who it is. That string will contain information on its application type, operating system, and software version currently in use.
Heres mine: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:66.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/66.0 but it could just as easily be Mozilla/5.0 (PlayStation 4 4.71) AppleWebKit/601.2 (KHTML, like Gecko).
If you&#39;ve ever been surfing the net on your mobile and selected &amp;ldquo;Request Desktop Site&amp;rdquo; then you have changed your phone browsers user agent.</description>

      <title>LessPass: A Primer</title>
      <link>https://danielms.site/blog/lesspass-eli5/</link>

      <description>LessPass The manager-less password manager LessPass, unlike other password managers does not store any information in a database or local cache. It simply takes in three pieces of information and then hashes that to return a password. If all three pieces of information haven&#39;t changed LessPass will always return the same password.
Why use it over other choices Straight from the creator himself:
 How do I synchronize this file on all my devices?</description>

      <title>Sqlite3: A Primer</title>

      <description>SQL Reference SQLite3 Specific Transactions SQLite transactions are ACID (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated and Durable). This means that data is not lost in the event of crashes, power failures or operating system dumps.
Atomic - Meaning changes cannot be broken down into smaller parts; either the entire transaction is commit or nothing at all.
Consistent - A transaction must ensure to change the database from one valid state to another. If a transaction results in invalid data, the database will revert its previous state.</description>

      <title>Public Key Crypto: The Basics</title>

      <description>Public Key Cryptography My simplest explanation TL;DR: Public key cryptography is a method of using a different key for the encryption and decryption of a file, message or other medium.
Public Key Cryptography What problem does it solve?
If two parties wish to exchange information to one another but the medium which they use to communicate is compromised, how do they share a secret key to unlock their encrypted messages? Symmetric key cryptography would make this untenable for the most part.</description>

      <title>Base64 ELI5</title>

      <description>Base64 Base64 is a common encoding scheme. But what is it, why 64 bits and how does it work?
TL;DR  Base64 is a binary to ASCII encoding that takes a byte (8 bits) and chunks its down into segments of 6 bits - six ones in binary equates to 64 which is where it derives its name.
 first, a demo Let&#39;s look at an example using the three letter word &amp;ldquo;The&amp;rdquo;.</description>
