# HTTP 101

![](/images/http-verbs.png 'Fetching a page across the internet')

## Prefetch

What happens when you type an address into the search bar and hit enter:

1. The browser extracts the domain name from the search bar
2. The hosts DNS cache is queried, if not found a DNS request is sent via your configured DNS server.
3. After getting the IP address via DNS, the host will initiate a TCP connection with that address.
4. If the connection is setup a response will be sent from the server and its data will be rendered using HTTP.

## HTTP

Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol for communications between a client and web server. It operates on a request-response model with the client initiating any connection to the server. 

Each request starts with a HTTP method which defines the request semantics indicating the purpose of the clients request and what the client expects in a successful response.

### **GET**

The most common request, it broadly asks the remote host to send the requested data back to the client. In general, `GET` requests will retrieve the data from a Uniform Request Identifier (URI).

Responses to a `GET` request are cacheable, meaning a cache can elect to use the it on subsequent `GET` and `HEAD` requests.

### **HEAD**

Very similar to the `GET` request except that it only retrieves the header information. All body content is omitted.

Responses to a `HEAD` request are cacheable, meaning a cache can elect to use the it on subsequent `GET` and `HEAD` requests.

### **POST**

A `POST` request will typically be sent via a HTML form and will effect some change on the server. According the [specification] it is indicated by the `Content-Type` header.

Common `POST` actions are things like adding new users, or payment processing. The `POST` sends that information to the server for it to be processed and declares the scheme it will use to send the data. The server needs this information so it knows how to handle the request. 


__Schemes:__

- `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
- `multipart/form-data`
- `application/json`

__Example:__

```sh
# Request
POST /payments HTTP/1.1
Host: bank.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 34

accountNumber=123&amount=9999&toAccount=789
```

Successful `POST` requests should get a `201 Created` response and a `Location` header pointing to the data's new URI.

```sh
# Response
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: /payments/<ID>/<transactionID>
```

### **PUT**

Similar to a `POST` request, a `PUT` references an already existing entity, and requests a update to it. The server must verify the validity of the data to be updated, and is not obligated to action the request. 

Every `PUT` is [idempotent] whereas `POST` requests are not. Each `POST` will have a new effect such as processing a payment as many times as the request was sent. 
This is one of the differences between the two at the HTTP level. But the most important difference is how the each request interactions with the URI it is requesting. 

A `PUT` must request must know the exact URI it needs to request. 

For example:

```sh
# Updates an existing record 
# OR adds a record to that exact URI
PUT /api/v1/books/3452 HTTP/1.1
Host: https://library-store.com/
```

Should return a `200 OK` or in some cases a `201 Created`.

[REST] API's usually adhere to the correct use of `PUT` and `POST` requests. A URI such as above is a good indication of a REST conforming web application.

### **DELETE**

A request to the server to call a function capable of deleting a specified entity. The server is responsible for checking and carrying out the function.

```sh
# Delete
DELETE /user/2341 HTTP/1.1
```

Should return a `202 Accepted`, `204 No Content` or `200 OK`.

### **TRACE**

An uncommon request that is often seen during diagnostics such as Traceroute. Can see what the server was delivered.

### **CONNECT**

For use with a proxy to initiate the connection.

### **OPTIONS**

A utility call that asks the server which HTTP methods are supported.

The `allow` header shows which options are authorized. Some applications prohibit the `OPTIONS` method and will return a `4XX` status code.

```sh
HTTP/2 200 
allow: OPTIONS, GET, HEAD, POST
cache-control: max-age=604800
content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
date: Sun, 14 Jul 2019 05:17:14 GMT
expires: Sun, 21 Jul 2019 05:17:14 GMT
server: EOS (vny006/044F)
content-length: 0
```
