# Python Inheritance

## A short primer

One of Object Orientated Programming's (OOP) strengths is in the ability to reuse
code, and cut down on repetition. Inheritance allows us to subclass a baseclass
and thereby use all of its attributes, or extend them. In otherwords, we can
create a "Parent" class, and then reference that parent in each child to share
their properties. 

Base class and parent class are used interchangably, as are subclass and child.
