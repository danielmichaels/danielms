A reminder to yourself to review what you've done this year. Catalogue your wins and reinforce *good* behaviour.

## 2020 In Review

Here is what I have to brag about in 2020 so far:

Technologies:

I have developed, integrated or otherwise taken the following technologies beyond "beginner", or enhanced these skills with the following examples.

- Angular
    - Gone from knowing zero Angular to being the lead  (sole) developer UI developer in a complex microservices application.
    - Lead the UI redesign including initial mock up and wireframes
    - Produced the scope of work within sprints
    - On boarded another UI developer and helped other experienced member re familiarise themselves with the code base
    - Deployed the redesign to production
- Vue.js
    - Built two separate web application with vue, both using Typescript
    - Both integrated into Python application backend's using [FastAPI][3]
- Ansible
    - Identified that creating the infrastructure for deployments is tedious, error prone and not easily repeatable made learning ansible a high priority.
    - Successfully created a playbook to create a consistent deploy environment for side projects;
        - update server security and packages
        - install load balancer
        - ensure small servers have sufficient swap space (to compile javascript)
        - git operations on private and public repositories
        - encrypt secrets using vault
        - development with Vagrant and live instances

- Flask
    - Developed a bespoke application which could interface with other custom devices on a large network
    - Utilised plain javascript and server side rendered templates to create a UX that users found more familiar than the tool it replaced
    - Integrated stripe into Flask
    - Used a third party websockets service to facilitate realtime chat between users
- FastAPI
    - Deployed two application with the framework, replacing it with Flask in one instance
- Docker (and swarm)
    - Went from having a rudimentary understanding to being able to create detailed docker-compose files and deploy to a swarm
    - Now use docker as my development environment
    - All side projects have been ported to swarm with load balancing and HTTPS included
    - Utilised kubernetes for a short notice project and learnt the basics of the platform

Skills:

- Leadership
    - Lead the UI design and implementation after being assigned to short staffed, over worked close knit team on a complex microservice architecture.
    - Integrated well with the team and was able to provide subject matter expertise in Angular within a short period of time
    - Became the lead developer of another project requiring the integration of two systems (both in python) requiring facilitation of planning and design sessions between the teams
    - Speaking role in presentations selling our new product to senior management, including live demonstration of our MVP
- Design
    - High-level planning sessions for the integration of two platforms
    - Mock up and wireframing the UI for another team's platform
- CI/CD
    - From being relatively inexperienced in CI/CD to developing pipelines for projects ranging from established to newly created
    - Learnt how to establish shell and docker runners in using Gitlab and AWS
    - Created segregated pipelines for separate deploys based on tags
    - Successfully integrated Github actions in all side project web applications, including deployment of containers to docker swarm
- Bash | Shell scripting
    - Took over established and complicated deployment shell scripts for production assets
    - Learnt a lot about debugging leading to the identification of several fixes resulting in the eradication of pipelines passing when they should have failed

Accomplishments:

- Deployed [lic-investing.online][0]
    - An Australian financial web application which visually shows whether certain stocks are trading at a premium or discount.
    - Uses FastAPI and Vue.js
    - Scrapes web resources using various techniques to gather the data, this includes punting that raw data into Postgres.
- Deployed [check-redirects.com][1]
    - Provides a service for tracing the redirection chain of a URL including status codes and response headers.
    - Includes an API for third parties
    - Built using FastAPI and Vue.js
- Replaced a rotting internal legacy tool with a web application:
    - Took an internal tool which was not being actively maintained and replaced it with Flask.
        - The tool needed to be either fixed or replaced to meet a looming deadline and our team was assigned to aid in unblocking the task
        - I first attempted to learn the code base and improve upon the design, however there were several critical issues which were cost prohibitive
        - After proposing a porting of the tool into a web application the design, implementation and handover of the task was completed in four weeks
        - This lead to the successful redeployment of a much needed tool, ultimately saving future development resources by rewriting it with a framework almost all developers in the organisation are familiar with.

After writing all this, its plain to see that I *have* achieved more than I realised.

The value in taking the time to write out what you have achieved over a period of time cannot be under estimated.

I did this in one sitting, unrefined and (mostly) unedited. This is for you to look back on and polish later **when you need it**.
