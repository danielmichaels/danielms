# REST API's

A quick primer on one of the most conjoined terms in any developers vernacular. What is a REST API, what does it mean and are API's and REST API's the same thing?

## API

The term API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a means by which another machine, application or developer can access parts or all of the functionality of a piece of software. When used as _REST API_ this will be referring to a __Web API__ which just means, an API that is accessible over a network. 

An example of an API in action would be hitting _like_ on an Instagram post. When a user likes a photo, it executes an API call which in turn sends data off to the server. In this case, the like is registered on a database and increments the like count on that users photo visibly displaying the increase.
