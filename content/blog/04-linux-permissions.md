Linux: Chmod and Chown
----------------------

### **Chmod: Change File Mode Bits**

```shell
15:45:18 user@example temporary 
total 12K
drwxr-xr-x  2 test users 4.0K Feb  1 14:29 .
drwx------ 33 test users 4.0K Feb  3 15:45 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 test users    0 Jan 21 12:14 1
-rw-r--r--  1 test users    0 Jan 21 12:14 3
-rw-r--r--  1 test users   16 Feb  1 14:29 file.txt
```

In the above example output from left to right we have: filemode, number
of links, user, group, size, date last modified, name of file.

We will focus on the filemode for now.

    drwxr-xr-x
    0123456789 <-- this is our reference marker.

0: is either `-` meaning a file, or `d`
signifying that it is a directory.

1-3: represents the user or owner of the file.

4-6: is reference to the group that owns the file.

7-9: everybody else, or other.

**Change the filemodes:**

The command `chmod` is used to change the mode files of
files. Its basic syntax is as follows:

In `chmod u+x file.txt` the `u` signifies `user` and the `+`
means add and the `x` refers to execute. This can be
stacked, and used to takeaway permissions.

`chmod -R g+rwx directory` would recursively
(`-R`) change all `group` files within
`directory` to read, write and execute.

Importantly, if the user or group **does not** own the file or directory
then the command `sudo` must be used. Otherwise it is not
needed.

**Octal:** 

In the above examples we used `rwx` to note what
permissions we wanted to add or remove from a file. Another method is to
use the *octal* notation; numeral.

`chmod 777 file.txt` would mean that we are giving
`rwx` to user, group and other. How does 7 equal
`rwx`?

This is because `4` gives read access, `2` is
write and `1`, execute. When using octal we add the numbers
together, so if we wanted read, write and execute we simply add 4,2,1
which equals 7.

`chmod 765 xxx.txt` would mean: - user: read, write and
execute -group: read and write - other: read and execute

Using this is very simple, but how do I remove permissions? Previously,
we would `chmod u-x` i.e.Â we used the `-` to
signify removal of privilege. Using octal we just set new filemode to
what we want and it will add or subtract the mode accordingly. An
example below:

`chmod a+rwx` == give read, write and execute to all
(user,group a)nd other) *or* `777`.

But if we only wanted the user to have `rwx` and everyone
else read and write we could call: `chmod 755`. To use
non-octal here would be `chmod go-x`.

Important note: As with all things linux there are many more advanced
features. We are just touching the surface here.

### Chown: Change File Owner and Group

The `chown` command deals with changing the ownership of
files and directories.

    drwxrwxr-x  1 test users 14.0K Jan 21 12:14 dir_1

    -rw-r--r--  1   admin   root   16 Feb  1 14:29 file.txt
    [filemode]     [owner] [grp]  

Above we have a break down of the important parts of our
`ls -la` output.

In the faked output we have `admin` in the first position
which is representing the owner/ creator of `file.txt`. In
postilion two we have the group that `file.txt` belongs to,
in this case its `root`.

The owner of a file can make changes to the filemode and ownership of a
file without super user privileges. However, if another user wanted to
change the ownership they would require this access.

To make a change is as simple as
`chown [user]:[group] [file/s]`.

    $ sudo chown root file.txt # 1.
    $ ls -l 
    -rw-r--r--  1 root root   16 Feb  1 14:29 file.txt

The simplest usage of `chown` is the command plus the new
owner and file or directory to be affected.

    $ sudo chown -R admin dir_1 # 2.
    $ ls -l
    drwxrwxr-x  1 admin users 14.0K Jan 21 12:14 dir_1

If we wanted to make the changes to all files and directories inside a
directory we can add `-R`. This is a recursive function
with the same syntax as `chmod`.

    $ sudo chown admin:admin file.txt 
    $ ls -l
    -rw-r--r--  1 admin admin   16 Feb  1 14:29 file.txt

To specify a new owner and group the use of `:` between the
owner and group can be used. `admin:users`, `root:root`
and so on.
