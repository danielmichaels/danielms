Elixir
======

    *Elixir is a functional, concurrent, general-purpose programming language that runs on the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM). Elixir builds on top of Erlang and shares the same abstractions for building distributed, fault-tolerant applications. Elixir also provides a productive tooling and an extensible design. The latter is supported by compile-time metaprogramming with macros and polymorphism via protocols*

It's pretty neat
----------------

Elixir is pretty cool but python it is not. And that is a good thing.
Sometimes it is worth exploring new things and learning something
different. I have been learning more about design patterns and
programming paradigms lately in an effort to round myself out. Something
that comes up a lot if functional programming, or how understanding it
can aid the developer in new ways of thinking about problems.

Dave Thomas gives a great intro to elixir's potential, and does it more
justice than I can (watch it
[here](https://player.vimeo.com/video/199860926)). To summarise it, we
need to capitalise on multicore systems rather than keep trying to
increase the clock speed, and thus use more energy and create more heat.
We can do this through parallelism and concurrency, and elixir is a
language built for this.

Now I haven't played around with it enough yet to say much about its
ease of use but I do think it has potential. So instead I will add a bro
science case study on its performance below.
