# Interview Questions Worth Considering

Today I stumbled across a job advert that had a section called **The Chat**. Here is the snippet 
of things they might ask you about during the interview.

1. **Language**: Why? What do you like and dislike about it?
2. **Domain Modelling**: What's it good for?
3. **Databases - Querying and Transactions**: what makes them challenging?
4. **API Design**: What's taken into consideration?
5. **Application Architecture**: Microservices, monoliths, event-driven, app servers and serverless; when and why?
6. **Testing and Code Quality**: Where and how does it add value?
7. **SCM**: Branching and merging flows - how do you like them?
8. **Logging, Metrics, and Monitoring**: What's the difference?
9. **Error handling and Debugging**: Describe your process and what's got you stuck in the past?
10. **SDLC and CI/CD**: Benefits and downfalls?
11. **Security**: What does that mean to you?

I like this because I immediately get the sense that this company *is* thinking about these issues, and potentially looking to see how you could fit in.

Most importantly, I realised that some of these points where weak spots, or rather I would need to collect my thoughts to answer effectively. 
How much of what I know is based on previous training/conditioning versus good practices. There is no right or wrong but having a well thought out
response to these questions is valuable - not just in an interview but at any time.
