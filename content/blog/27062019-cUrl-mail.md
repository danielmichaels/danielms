# Curl 

Today I learnt that Curl can also be used to send emails. One of my projects is to manage a fleet of embedded devices that communicate information back to our servers. Email is one part of this process. And, `curl` is installed on these devices, greatly simplifying things.

## Syntax

```sh
# gmail specific 
curl --url 'smtps://smtp.gmail.com:587' --ssl-reqd \
--mail-from 'username@gmail.com' --mail-rcpt 'rcpt@email.com' \
--user 'username@gmail.com:password' --insecure \
--upload-file fileToBeUploaded.txt
```

Let's break down each component:

- `--url` - specifies the SMTP server address and port
- `--ssl-reqd` - mandates SSL/TLS must be used
- `--mail-from` - who sent the email
- `--mail-rcpt` - the addressee
- `--user` - credentials for the mail server
- `--insecure` - a `curl` idiom that tells `curl` to ignore CA errors and continue
- `upload-file` - `curl` cannot send a body, but will accept an [RFC 5322] compliant text file as its message. Json, HTML and text data can be sent by adding a `Content-Type` header appropriate to the type of data being sent.
