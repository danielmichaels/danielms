# Curl 

Today I learnt that Curl can also be used to send emails. One of my projects is to manage a fleet of embedded devices that communicate information back to our servers. Email is one part of this process. 

Usually, `sendmail` and `mailx` fulfil this task but for reasons they were not functioning as intended and a workaround was needed quickly. Fortunately, `BusyBox` comes with `curl` installed.

## Syntax


```sh
# gmail specific 
curl --url 'smtps://smtp.gmail.com:587' --ssl-reqd \
--mail-from 'username@gmail.com' --mail-rcpt 'rcpt@email.com' \
--user 'username@gmail.com:password' --insecure \
--upload-file fileToBeUploaded.txt
```

## Bash script
