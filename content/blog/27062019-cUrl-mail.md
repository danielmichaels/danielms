# Curl

![](/images/curl-logo.svg "curl icon")

Today I learnt that Curl can also be used to send emails. One of my projects is to manage a fleet of embedded devices that communicate information back to our servers. Email is one part of this process. And, `curl` is installed on these devices, greatly simplifying things.

## Syntax

```sh
# gmail specific
curl --url 'smtps://smtp.gmail.com:587' --ssl-reqd \
--mail-from 'username@gmail.com' --mail-rcpt 'rcpt@email.com' \
--user 'username@gmail.com:password' --insecure \
--upload-file fileToBeUploaded.txt
```

Let's break down each component:

- `--url` - specifies the SMTP server address and port
- `--ssl-reqd` - mandates SSL/TLS must be used
- `--mail-from` - who sent the email
- `--mail-rcpt` - the addressee
- `--user` - credentials for the mail server
- `--insecure` - a `curl` idiom that tells `curl` to ignore CA errors and continue
- `upload-file` - `curl` cannot send a body, but will accept an [RFC 5322] compliant text file as its message. Json, HTML and text data can be sent by adding a `Content-Type` header appropriate to the type of data being sent.

Curl [documentation](https://ec.haxx.se/usingcurl-smtp.html).

## Bash script

A simple example bash script to illustrate some of the potential that this curl functionality provides us. The code can be found [here][1].

![](/images/bash.png "bash icon")

```sh
#!/bin/bash
# A simple email script that takes a recipient and
# RFC5322 compliant text file as the message body.

echo "Curl auto-emailer"
echo "SUPPORTS GMAIL ONLY"

RCPT=$1 # 'username@example.com'
FILE=$2 # takes a filename, relative or abs path
FROM=server@gmail.com # 'me@me.com'
EMAIL=server@gmail.com:p@ssword # 'username@gmail.com:password'

if [ -z "$1" ]
  then
    echo "Missing argument 1; recipient address\
      eg username@gmail.com"
    exit
elif [ -z "$2" ]
then
  echo "Missing argument; File to be uploaded"
  exit
else
  curl --url 'smtp://smtp.gmail.com:587' --ssl-reqd \
    --mail-from $FROM --mail-rcpt $RCPT \
    --user $EMAIL --upload-file $FILE  --insecure
fi
```

This is for demonstration purposes only. Also, its worth mentioning that entering credentials in the commandline without the appropriate safe guards can be a security issue!

## Further Reading

Check out `curl wttr.in` and `curl rates.sx` in your terminal for some of the more interactive things that can be done with this great tool.
The possibilities of `curl` are nearly endless and its used by many of us everyday. 

If you want to learn more about sending emails from the commandline then [this][2] might be worth a read. More information about sending HTML RFC5322 complaint message body files can be found [here][3].
