Hey Iâ€™m Dan. I am now a software developer but in a past life was a soldier and
served nearly a decade in the special forces. This is my outlet away from the
day to day of working at a big corporation as a developer.

I mostly work with Python and Javascript. Though I'm really digging Go, and
think it has a bright future for both web and automation; particularly devops.

A lot of people like to ask me about the *cool* stuff I once did, so I'll
occasionally write about that as it was a huge part of my life.

These days, I can be found either trying to launch a profitable online business
or hanging out with my family and friends. I love ice hockey (go bruins!) and
in general trying to be a little bit better than yesterday.
