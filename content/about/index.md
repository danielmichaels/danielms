Hey Iâ€™m Dan. I am now a software developer but in a past life was a soldier and
served nearly a decade in the special forces. This is my outlet away from the
day to day of working at a big corporation as a developer.

I mostly work with Python, Go and Javascript. These days I'll reach for Go before
anything else.

These days, I can be found either trying to launch a profitable online business
or hanging out with my family and friends. I love ice hockey (go bruins!), hunting and
in general trying to be a little bit better than yesterday.
