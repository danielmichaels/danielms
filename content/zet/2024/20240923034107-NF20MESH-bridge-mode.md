# NF20MESH bridge mode

This thing is a POS.

To set bridge mode do the following:

- disable wifi 2.4/5g and stop SSID being broadcast
- remove all connections
- disable DHCP on v4 and v6
- add ptm and eth connections back as bridge mode

Now kick the connection on ABB and power off for a couple of minutes
