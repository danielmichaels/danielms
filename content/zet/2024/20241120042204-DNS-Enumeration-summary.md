## QUOTES:

- "DNS is the staple of everything and when things break we can always blame it
  on DNS."
- "There's just so many tools out there."
- "The essence of why we write a tool is because a lot of people starting out
  need good resolvers."
- "The first two core spaces are passive and active."
- "Community is so important; the more you got in community, the more you
  learn."
- "You can learn to code in one language and better translate yourself to
  another."
- "It's a classic catch-all; you will send an email to a server and it will
  respond."
- "You don't always have to get a result; you just want to know."
- "If you see a few people suddenly starring a project, it's a good indication
  they're onto something."
- "Speed, reliability, and the ability to pipe into other tools are key metrics
  for evaluating tools."
- "You can get more insight by running it yourself."
- "The DNS space is probably the best example of why community is important."
- "The essence of DNS vulnerabilities is that they're often overlooked."
- "Rebinding attacks can reveal internal resources previously thought secure."
- "Subdomain takeovers have historically been the most profitable bug in bug
  bounty hunting."
- "Every person who goes out there and writes a tool deserves recognition."
- "You need to introduce other resolvers if you're scaling."
- "DNS is a foundational element in cybersecurity."
- "Effective DNS enumeration involves both passive and active techniques."
- "Historical DNS data provides insights into vulnerabilities and attack
  patterns."
