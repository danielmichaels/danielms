# AI on the cow

I'm AI exhausted. Most AI-first products/business are junk (clawdbot being an temporal example at time of writing).

This on the other hand is a real, tangible use case. They're running a tiny model on constrained embedded controllers attached to a cows neck.

It runs inference on the telemetry of the cow in 7ms which (as they state) significantly reduces battery draw. If anomoly is detected then it will
wake the board and send packets of BLE-LE to a base station. The base station then forwards it to the (Go) backend for processing and storing into
TimescaleDB.

And, I'm glossing over all the embedded work they've done like design their own chips and their own pick-n-place machine to prototype boards!

Honestly amazing and reminds that I love embedded stuff - might whip out the arduino's and esp32's!
