# Voyager-1 an engineering feat

I am blown away that the Voyager-1 spacecraft is nearly 45 years old
and still functional. Engineers are still administering this craft, most
of whom were not born when it launched! We have multi-billion dollar
companies experiencing days of downtime with more engineers than you can
shake a stick at, and then we have this beast.

It takes 20 hours to receive data from the vessel! It is also the **only**
spacecraft we have in deep space. 

What an absolute marvel of **modern** engineering.
