# WGD Fri 2022-06-17

## Storeman

- Finished the basic endpoints for Containers and Items, meaning users
  can add a container and then put items in it. QR code and image support WIP
- Started on the QR code support branch

## Mudmap

- Admin users can now invite users by email to join their Organisation
- Started work on the invite token storage and endpoints on the backend
- Fielded some questions about pricing for non-for-profit foundations - something I had not
  considered.

## Misc

- Preparations for moving house continue 
- Signed up for a three day adventure training course in the alpine regions
  where we'll learn some basic snow camping and survival skills.
