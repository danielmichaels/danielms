# ANZAC Day COVID Bullshit

ANZAC Day Dawn Service in Perth 2022 is invite only with a maximum 
attendance capacity of 500 due to COVID restrictions.

The local football team - The West Coast Eagles - home attendance's 
for 2022:

- Round 1: 20,932
- Round 3: 38,920
- Round 5: 42,888

What a load of absolute bullshit. We all know why. There is no
money made from a memorial service but football, cha-ching. 

Risk versus Reward in capitalist society will forsaken those who made 
the ultimate sacrifice to pursue a few Shekels.
