# Old skills, new skills

Where I've been is not where I am today. I've been uploading some old 
photos from a hard drive to the cloud. Looking over them with some 
nostalgia and a level of pride about how I transitioned from one life
to the next. For a guy that never finished high school and was told I'd
never amount to anything, I've done alright.
