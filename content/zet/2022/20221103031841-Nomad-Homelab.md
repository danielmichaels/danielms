# Nomad Homelab

I use kubernetes at work as a developer and as a maintainer. This includes
OpenShift and k3s. For big org's or teams this is great but I am starting
to come around to the idea that it's too much for us. Perhaps Nomad
is a better more easy to administer solution.

Things I am interested in about Nomad:

- `qemu` driver and `docker` driver
- HCL (we use HCL for packer and terraform already)
- Simpler, single binary setup
- Native integration into Vault
- Service discovery in-built (or can use Consul)
- Great UI

Things I'll miss:

- Terminal interface like k9s (thouse `damon` exists as a Nomad version)
- K8s ecosystem
- Much less internet documentation
- More work to get some apps going (compared to the plethora of helm charts out there)

What I worry about (for org, not pers use):

- Enterprise paywall

Over this holidays I will be bringing up my own cluster to play 
around with.
