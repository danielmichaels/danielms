Comments:

Dan has exceeded expectations. He is a high performing member whose contribution
has been critical to the delivery of XXXX and XXX's ability to meet its
strategic objectives. He has, without doubt, developed and implemented 
complex programs that have achieved an excellently engineered result.
He built the persistence functionality for XXXX and drove this essential
requirement through to production. Additionally, he took over the development
of another highly specialised software component for the project at short
notice. He not only delivered the highly specialised features and integrations,
but improved upon the original design.

Dan has consistently contributed to XXX's software engineering processes and
mentored members of XXX's XXXX team in integrating and streamlining code to
enable XXXX. He has taken on work to professionalise the XXX XXX structure
and permissions. He has enabled a self-service process which automates the
creation and launching of resources without the need for manual intervention
by XXX staff. He has been responsible for running user acceptance testing and
XXXX familiarisation sessions for stakeholders. Dan is a very resonpsive and
valued member of XXX and an asset to the section.
