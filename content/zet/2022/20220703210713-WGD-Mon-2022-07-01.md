# WGD Mon 2022-07-01

## [Mudmap]

- After a month of working with the Auth0 Authorization extension, I ripped it out
  Instead, I've replaced it with the much simpler Management API and have achieved the same thing.

## Misc

- Moved house 
- Started seeing my EP twice a week

A light week in terms of *work* but very busy packing, moving and unpacking for the move.
Moving is such a painful experience but on the whole we're really happy we did it. This house
is much nicer.
