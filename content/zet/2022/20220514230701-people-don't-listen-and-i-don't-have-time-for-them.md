# People don't listen and I don't have time for them

Last night I was at a house warming and did some light mingling with people
who I mostly don't know. Only two people, the host and another bloke,
actually conversed with me. Everyone else, was having a one-way conversation
where they were talking at me or waiting for their chance to speak. It
is a common thread in my interactions with people these days.

Honestly, they are doing me a favour by exposing themselves quickly as 
someone to not waste any more time with.

Life is too short for these kind of interactions.
