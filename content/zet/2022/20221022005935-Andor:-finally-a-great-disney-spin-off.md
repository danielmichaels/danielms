# Andor: finally a great disney spin off

As a Star Wars fan who hated the Mandalorian and all the other crap 
Disney+ money grabs, I am pretty happy with Andor.

The plot is interesting, Cassian's character is realistic and gritty.
Diego Luna does a great job playing him unlike the half-arsed acting in
the other spin-offs. That villain woman from Obiwan was so unbelievable
and over the top that it totally ruined it for me. 

Star Wars should focus more on these plot driven, unrelated to to the typical
story line shows. I mean, c'mon Luke Skywalker in the Mandalorian was just.. bad!
Also, the Mandalorian literally had no storyline. Just crap.
