# Vim Filters

Today I learnt about (and showed some vim-hater colleagues) vim filters.

I am still at the point of consciously thinking about them. So, I've already noticed 
a few spots where I could of used a filter but instead dropped back to what I know.

A few contrived and simple examples.

**Get the first zet with a #golang tag**

```vim
:r !ds zet t golang | awk '{print $1} | head -n 1
# 20220424000235
```

**Get unix time**

```vim
:r !ds uniq second
# 1650971184
```

**Line count for this document**

```vim
:r !wc -l #
# 16 zet/20220426105644/README.md
```

These are so basic its not funny but gaining an awareness is the start. Conscious thought when
writing leads to the mental leaps which turn things like this into *muscle memory*.
