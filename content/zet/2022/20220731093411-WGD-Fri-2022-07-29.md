# WGD Fri 2022-07-29

## Mudmap

- Sent out a number of emails to clients who have been having difficulties getting devices
  onboarded to get feedback
- Updated some of the documentation
- Ruled out an error I was seeing in testing as the cause of onboarding issues

## Misc

- Applied to renew my contract, which is actually a *new* contract so I will have to interview
  for it.
- Helped out a mate build a [wails](https://wails.dev) application using
  [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)

Continuing to get more and more deep into kubernetes at work. I totally understand why
the CNCF landscape has a market cap of 10T USD. The thing is a massive pain in the arse 
but insanely useful.
