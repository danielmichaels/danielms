# RF based detection: terms and definitions

A few definitions for radio frequency detection tools.

## Acousto-Magnetic

Emits a signal at 58kHz in bursts which energise any tag caught in the surveillance zone. 
These are very effective at tracking items which may contain metals or metallic paint. 
Tags are quite small though I don't think they are coded meaning you cannot track items
with this alone.
