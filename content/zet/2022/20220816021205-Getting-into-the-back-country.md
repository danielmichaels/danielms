# Getting into the back country

Over the last weekend I undertook a snow survival course in the back country
near Threadbo. What a great weekend, and an awakening. I think I should
do some more stuff down there and maybe even get some skiing in. 

In the meantime here are the things I need to buy, and learn.

## Buy

- z-fold mat
- better hard shell (pants and jacket)
- synthetic jacket pref with water repellent outer
- 75L+ pack

## Learn

- weather systems
- layering
- climbing knots
- climbing anchors
