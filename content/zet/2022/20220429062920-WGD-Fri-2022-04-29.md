# WGD Fri 2022-04-29

## [Mudmap](https://mudmap.io)

I added some extra notifications, namely webhooks, whenever a user
increments or decrements their device numbers in Stripe. I.e. when 
a payment intent is sent for a subscription. 

Also, spent some time investigating firewall connection issues which 
a user notified me about. Ultimately, I could not replicate the issue. 
What they provided me works but I look forward to their response as 
it could be affecting other users as most don't report issues.

I started mulling over the idea of switching to using HTTP, or 
providing it in addition to SSH for Mudmap connections. I understand
that this means exposing the firewall's user interface to the internet
but it would be locked down to a few IP's. Which is what happens with 
SSH currently - though SSH is more secure than a web server. Needs 
more thought but what makes this even more appealing is the API client 
I use is soon releasing a OpenAPI document so I should be able to 
auto-generate HTTP endpoints.

## [ds]

I integrated [zet-cmd] into [ds] and updated the underlying dependencies. 

## [zet-cmd]

I have too many notebooks. My writings and scribbles go into a book
and get lost, forever gone and never looked upon again. So I am 
*kinda* re-inventing the wheel yet again and trying something I
have failed at before, taking my notes online.

So, I decieded to create a [zettelkasten] tool for cataloguing my 
various thoughts in a way that is publicly accessible. Unlike my 
[blog](https://danielms.site) which I tend to take a little more
time curating, these entries should be more raw with less care for 
grammar or correctness. 

And, because I'm a developer, I created a tool to do this. It uses
[bonzai] to create a simple (easy to use for me) CLI tool for writing 
markdown files. This is written in my zet repo and copy pasted into 
[What Got Done](https://whatgotdone.com).

So far, [zet-cmd] can do the following:

- create new zet's 
- edit zet's 
- search by title and tags 
- commit and push to GitHub 

## Conclusion

Work has been pretty interesting and fun this week. I've been pulling
longer hours but the days have been good. A lot of k8s work which I
really enjoy.
