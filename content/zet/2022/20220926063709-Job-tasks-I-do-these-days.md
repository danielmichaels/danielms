# Job tasks I do these days

A list of all the types of things I am doing in my day job, and in my own time.

- CI/CD
  - gitlab pipelines
  - GitLab API access to cross system boundaries with runners in different tenancies (no access
    outside certain operations)
  - Pipeline maintenance 
- Kubernetes
  - Building applications for kubernetes
    - Using non-greedy operations because scaling horizontally is better
  - Administering production and staging clusters
  - Administering user access and control for the team
  - Fixing bad deployments and broken helm charts
  - Attempting to transition the environment over to ArgoCD (we have little oversight when things
    drift)
  - Stood up and introduced k3s to the team
    - we now run k3s locally with verified fakes for our third party API's
- Bash Scripting
  - I use Bash for so many things and feel like I'm getting decent at it
- Python
  - I code review major deployments
  - I write python most days using Rabbit and websocket backends
- Golang
  - Fairly competent having written a large code base entirely in it
  - Reach for it instead of python for CLI or automations which bash isn't suitable for
  - Experienced somewhat in writing gRPC code for Go
