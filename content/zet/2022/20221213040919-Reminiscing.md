# Reminiscing

Listening to a workmate talk about shooting MP5's and other
guns whilst at re:Invent last week brought back from memories.

He was talking about how wild it was shooting an MP5 on fully automatic.

I've dropped a whole mag straight through a windscreen then made a fighting 
withdrawal throwing smoke, grenades and shooting off 40mm. The MP5k has
some kick but it don't matter too much when you just trying to kill anything
in front of you with it.

Fond memories from a life I used to lead and also took for granted. We
truly lived most men's dreams. 

10/10 do not regret my time in the Regiment.
