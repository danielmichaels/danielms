# goland: highlight error without mouse hover

In Goland (and probably all intellij products; keymap dependant) to display
the squiggly underline tooltip for a problem/error all you need is Alt+t

Couple this with displaying a function/methods comments (Shift+k) and I
now rarely need to use my mouse at all.
