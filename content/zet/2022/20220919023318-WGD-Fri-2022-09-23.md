# WGD Fri 2022-09-23

- Deployed Jellyfin in my house.
  - Can't believe how good it is and why I didn't do this sooner

- Refactoring Mudmap sql to use SQLc
  - It's a lot of work but so far is totaly worth it. Building new queries is so easy
  - The only thing I don't like is how it handles `enums` in Postgres

- Spent all week at work refactoring a series of Gitlab pipelines
  - Nested `includes` are not a lot of fun. 

- Started learning a bit more about gRPC and Protobuf's for a project
  - It's a different way of thinking when you've mostly done REST using JSON.
