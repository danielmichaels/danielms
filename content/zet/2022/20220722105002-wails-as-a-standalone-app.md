# wails as a standalone app

The other day a friend suggested we build a tool but he wanted it to be
a standalone GUI application. It needed to be a single binary and usable
across Windows, MacOS and Linux. 

After some research, including C++, Java and Kotlin, we stumbled upon 
[wails](https://wails.dev). After about an hours of playing around it was 
obvious it met all those requirements, and it was familiar to web development.

My [demo](https://github.com/danielmichaels/wails-demo) is bare bones 
example of hitting a 3rd party API with it. It uses [svelte](https://svelte.dev).

On a side note, this is first and only svelte app I've ever developed and 
it was very easy to use with great documentation. I see big things for
svelte in the future.
