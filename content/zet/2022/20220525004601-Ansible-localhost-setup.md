# Ansible localhost setup

As I've now committed myself to Ubuntu, setting up an Ansible playbook 
for my personal machine is probably a good idea. I already have several 
several playbooks for my cloud VM's.

Things which will need automating:

- Dotfiles
- `ds`, `zet`
- github repo's (mudmap, zet, ds, dot)
- oh-my-zsh
- starship
- i3 (i3status-rust) & xandr
- opera, vivaldi
- pycharm, golang, webstorm
- curlie, exa, air
- Go (latest)
- Docker (podman, too)

Apt packages:

- psql
- vim
- zsh
- curl
- python3
- npm, yarn, node
