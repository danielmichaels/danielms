# Hobby as a job has its downsides

When I was in the army my mental stimulation hobby was coding. I'd work
odd hours, sometimes away for weeks at a time with no downtime. So whenever
I could I would be coding up something. This process was hugely rewarding to me.

Now that my day job is coding, and my hobby is coding it's *less* rewarding.

Not in a bad way - I still love getting home to work on *my* stuff. Instead
in a way that I now know how hard it can be to build something from start
to finish, and to maintain it. It makes me less keen on building things 
that maybe a few years ago I would of jumped at. This means I'm giving
up things that I'd otherwise do simply because my hobby is also my job.
At least that's how I see it.
