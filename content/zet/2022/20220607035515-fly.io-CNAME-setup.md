# fly.io CNAME setup

I started using [fly.io](https://fly.io) today and so far it is pretty 
awesome.

tl;dr [share.danielms.site](https://share.danielms.site)

I setup everything without much issue but coming from Render, setting up
the CNAME was not as easy (in hindsight, its super simple).

After deploying my [PicoShare](https://github.com/mtlynch/picoshare) app
using the fantastic `flyctl` CLI, I could easily access it from its [fly
domain](https://picoshare-danielms.fly.dev) but I wanted to put it on my
personal website as a subdomain.

Netlify is my DNS provider, so I setup a CNAME over there but it would
not resolve - OpenSSL error. Turns out you need to manually generate 
the certificate for the subdomain. 

To do that:

```
fly certs create share.danielms.site

> The certificate for share.danielms.site has not been issued yet.
> 
> Hostname                  = share.danielms.site
> 
> DNS Provider              = nsone
> 
> Certificate Authority     = Let's Encrypt
> 
> Issued                    =
> 
> Added to App              = 35 seconds ago
> 
> Source                    = fly
> 
> Your certificate for share.danielms.site is being issued. Status is Awaiting certificates. Make sure to create another certificate for www.share.danielms.site when the current certificate is issued.
```

Check the status with `fly certs show share.danielms.site`. It only takes
a few seconds to deploy anyway but this will show if there are any errors.
