# zerolog: reference article

[zerolog](https://github.com/rs/zerolog) is my go to logger for all Go
applications.

I stumbled upon this [article](https://betterstack.com/community/guides/logging/zerolog/)
and had to capture it somewhere for future reference. It covers every thing
I'll ever need. Already it's given me some inspiration for cleaning up
some loggers.
