# Laravel DX is incredible

Today, on a whim, I ran through the laravel tutorial. 

I know zero PHP so I didn't understand some of the syntax but the developer experience
is absolutely first rate.

If I were to choose between Django and Laravel I would definitely reach for Laravel
first. I didn't even get into all the add-ons yet and I'll already blown away.

The PHP itself didn't seem so bad; people bemoan it hard but on the surface
it seems pretty decent.

Might knock up a little app in it over the holidays and see how the full dev->deployment
cycle goes.

One thing that blew me away is [sail](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/sail). It lets you
run laravel and all of its ecosystem from within docker. I initially tried setting up PHP 
but hit various roadblocks before I found sail. I removed all PHP components and installed 
sail (which is really just a bash script and docker container). After that all of laravel's
CLI tools where magically embedded into sail. I don't know another framework/language which 
does this or does it *this* well.
