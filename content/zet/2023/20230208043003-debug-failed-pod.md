# debug failed pod

I was trying to debug a python job which created a pod using
a bunch of `argparse` arguments.

This is how I figured out how to run all the python args and if
it failed throw a sleep in bash. This then let me jump in 
and see what was actually happening on the container.

*appreviated*

```yaml
# truncated
    command: ["bash", "-c"]
    args:
      - >-
        python script.py -l foo -b far || sleep 10000;
# truncated
```
