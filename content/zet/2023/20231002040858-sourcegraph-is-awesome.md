# Sourcegraph is awesome

I've yet to find a way to control my snippets. I tried `snips.sh` but found it a little too
finicky. It is a cool project but sometimes I need to capture more context than just a snippet. Like how does *x* fit into *y*
and it might be several lines long or be across modules (Go specific here).

Sourcegraph lets me do that. I can just add my project and then search for a term and voila. It's possible to navigate forward and backward
through interfaces, methods and even commit history. It can do much more but that covers what I wanted so far. What I also like is that it 
runs on my Caprover instance and I can now login to it from anywhere. This is a cool feature as sometimes I'll be dreaming up some idea 
and need to check something. Now I just login and search around from any computer, or phone. 

Well worth checking out. Now I just need to convince my team we need it because searching around on GitLab when you have multiple microservices
and you can't remember which one does *xyz* is an absolute PITA.
