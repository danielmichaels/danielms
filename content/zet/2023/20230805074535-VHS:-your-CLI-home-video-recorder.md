# VHS: your CLI home video recorder

I just removed my 'peek' recorded `demo.gif` from my `gpt` wrapper CLI tool's `README.md` and replaced it 
with a `vhs` tape.

It's so much better looking but can seriously prevent doxing information. Sometimes when recording something you 
can accidently include identifying information. Not with `vhs`, it records in its own custom terminal. Yet still 
honours your terminals bindings.

See the demo: <https://github.com/danielmichaels/gpt>
