# snips.sh and zet

I like to capture snippets but have found that incorporating 
well formatted, context aware and runnable examples in this zet
challenging.

Today I found [snips.sh](https://github.com/robherley/snips.sh) and 
its really awesome. I'm going to try it out as a way to enrich my zets.

Here is an example: <https://snips.infra.ptco.rocks/f/32pTsJRvI_>

This is a real file from a project I have which uses NATS as its message service.

To create that snippet all I needed to do was `cat <file>.go | ssh snips`.

This then saved my snippet to my `snips.sh` instance. 

Because `snips.sh` takes input from stdin I think it'll make a great partner
to this type of notes capture.
