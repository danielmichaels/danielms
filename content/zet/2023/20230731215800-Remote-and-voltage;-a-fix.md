# Remote and voltage; a fix

Happy that I fixed a suddenly "broken" TV remote. The TV was reporting that 
the batteries had gone flat, so I replaced them. Still didn't work and said it's
flat.

Got out the multimeter to test old and new.

Old: 1.4~V
New: 1.6V

So I put an old and new together in series and tested, came to ~3.0v

Put them in the remote and it works perfectly.

Now I know you're not meant to mix batteries but considering how sensitive this remote is, I don't care!
