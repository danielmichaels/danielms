# Erik Prince: The Rise and Fall of Blackwater

Today I listened to a podcast with Erik Prince the founder of Blackwater.

It was honestly the most inspiring and interesting podcast I've listened
to in a long time. Some key takeaways,

- Bias for action: Erik gets it done.
- Pragmatic and practical. He does not overthink (or underthink)
- Men, Mission and then Me; a true leader putting the men first
- A strong believer in acting within the spirit of *A letter to Garcia*.
  - I hadn't thought about this in a few years and it made me sad. 
- *Better to employ your rivals than fight them*
- Re-cock and go again; don't let failure get in the way just take another angle.
- A *why can't we do that* guy - things aren't just "that's how it is" with Erik 
- A fantastic businessman with a good appreciation for history.
- Military bureaucracy breeds *zampolit* behaviour.
  - Case in point we had lawyers in our organisation that vetted each job; not to protect us but to
  make sure it conformed to the will of the political power!

So much of what Erik spoke about absolutely resonated with me. I fought in
Iraq and Afghanistan and what a fucking joke those wars became through 
pathetic leadership at the top and in parliament.
