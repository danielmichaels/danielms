# New year, new challenges

Starting off 2024 by embracing the unknown.

We're moving interstate, just bought our first home, having a baby and as of
last week, now unemployed!

It's interesting times in the household with a lot of exciting and daunting changes ahead.
We can't wait to move into our new house - it's a nice house up the mountain. Lots of space
for the kiddo's, a pool and surrounded by nature.

The lack of job is a curveball though it *should* only be temporary (a contract error)
but nonetheless is a blemish on the whole experience.

My family and friends think we're crazy for buying a house whilst technically unemployed and moving and 
expecting another child. But, you gotta risk it for the biscuit!

Mind you, if anyone reading this needs some short term Go or python work - hit me up!

Otherwise, bring on 2024 as I can't wait to move up to the Sunshine state (again).
