# fc is a hidden linux gem

TIL about `fc` or fix command.

Typing `fc` and hitting enter will drop you into your `$EDITOR` and let
you edit the last command. Saving will execute it.

For long curl requests its amazing. Now I can send a command and `fc` into 
to alter the endpoint data etc using vim whilst keeping all the authentication
fields intact.

It's far easier than re-issuing the command via the terminal prompt even
with vim bindings.
