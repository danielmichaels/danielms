# Github UI needs vimium extension to be useful

`<rant>`

Long issues/PR's etc in Github UI are a real PITA to navigate around. For instance, if I want to see the status of the branches actions I have to go all the way to the bottom of the page.

If you don't have vimium installed I don't know what you do here except scroll like a maniac (I'm sure there's other hotkeys). `<Shift>-G` is a saviour here. 

I think GitLab's experience is far superior here. Firstly, the important stuff is at the top of the fold; Merge and pipeline statuses. Secondly, all comments can 
be nested in GitLab; something thats not possible in Github. Having to create another entry on the page just to reply to a question (which could be several comments back)
is really bad UX. 

I feel like Github exists this way solely to be different to GitLab and because its the incumbent and they have zero incentive to change. Possibly, a lot of 
developers don't know there's a better experience waiting for them as they've never used GitLab properly.
