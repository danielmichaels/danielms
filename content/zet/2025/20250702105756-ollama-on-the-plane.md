# Ollama on the plane

I was doing some work offline on a flight today and (sadly) reached for AI only to realise my usual wasn't available whilst offline.

Then I remembered I setup `ollama` with `qwen3` the other day. Well it worked really well in helping me figure out how to use a library. 
I haven't used `ollama` in a long time and found the local models quite inferior to online but `qwen3` was really quite good.

I think having access to an offline model is a real boon for productivity, especially when you just want to consult docs and ask questions about
simple stuff like that.
