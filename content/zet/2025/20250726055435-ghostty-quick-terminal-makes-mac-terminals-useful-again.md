# Ghostty quick-terminal makes Mac terminals useful again

A while back I whinged hard about terminals on Mac. At the time I was unaware, or it didn't exist - not sure - of Ghostty's "quick terminal".

This for my interests works exactly the same as how I've setup iTerm to dropdown using F12. Which is/was the only way to achieve what *many* linux terminals offer out of the box. Yakuke, Guake and ddterm being examples of this. 

I think now I can safely transition from iTerm and WezTerm (still love the lua configs..) and make Ghostty my daily. 

Some references:

- https://ghostty.org/docs/features#macos

Note, I've not tested quick term on linux. I have read conflicting reports; x11 is okay but wayland might not be supported. Honestly, I think it'll eventually get support there but it would be a real shame if it doesn't get implemented. Still, linux has many great offerings and I largely use Zellij inside Ghostty anyway which works in Guake/Yakuke/ddterm as-is
