# Working across timezones

This week I've had meetings across several timezones, delivered a demo at 0200 (my time) and still got heaps of work done.

In the lead up to the demo I've been chatting with colleagues in Europe and the US. Being part of a distributed global team
means some times *out of hours* calls are required. 

When I explain that I'm talking to someone at 2100 or delivering a demo at 0200 they think two things; I'm crazy and that I have no "work life balance". 

I think they're wrong.

For me, it works. I can hand off to others, or wake up to find *x* project is no longer blocked freeing me up to start working on it immediately.

As for the late night calls, they aren't so bad. I have *a lot* of experience working **long** hours at odd times often cold, wet and hungry.

Going to bed at 2200, waking up at 0145 to deliver a demo from the comfort of my warm house, then going back to my comfy bed.. that is a privilege!

That is life on easy mode. Some times, perspective is all you need. 

Being woken for picket at 0200 after only getting to bed at 0000, doing an hour on watch, then waking again at 0500 before first light - only then to do another full day's patrolling. That's hard! Software development is easy in comparison.

An easy, enjoyable trade-off. I love this career!
