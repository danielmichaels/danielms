# Github is the Microsoft of VCS

And the irony of Microsoft owning Github is not lost on me.

Github is the de facto, first to market hosted git repo.

We all know it got market share because it was first to market, in SV and gave you free private repo's from the get go.

People equate github with git - I'm sure some even think Github created git!

Anyway, after the new pricing for Github Actions self-hosted runners I think its become so painfully obvious that its a dying product.

GitLab is superior. Fact. End of story.

If you haven't used GitLab in a commerical production environment you really don't know what you're missing out on. GitLab CE/free-tier just ain't the same.

Gitea, Forejo aren't it either - they're just GitHub dressed up in a new suit. I mean Gitea modelled their "actions" after GHA - what the hell.

I swear I'm becoming more GitLab pilled every day!
