# NATS and Fly Gateway proxy

- [Woodpecker CI, NATS and Fly.io](https://badlyenginee.red/posts/2025-06-24-woodpecker-proxy/)

This was posted in my work chat today. It's a simple but easy to understand and briefly touches on some of the power of NATS. 

NATS small footprint, and ability to use leaf nodes really blows up the possibilities for the tool. The fact that John is leveraging Synadia Cloud
with his home leaf node is really powerful. I love reading about how people are using these technologies and platforms to build what they *want*
rather than shoehorning ideas into the requirements and limitations of other tools.

Also, echo's my distain for GitHub Actions. I think Dagger is the future of CI these days but Woodpecker/Drone is nice too.
