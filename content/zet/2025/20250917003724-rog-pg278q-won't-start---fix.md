# ROG PG278Q Won't start - fix

This monitor is a POS. Whenever we get a power outage this thing has issues starting back up.

I think the capacitors are faulty and the only way I've been able to *semi*-reliably get it back up and going is to turn it off for 30+ seconds. This seems to discharge the capacitors and then it will start.

It happens infrequently enough that I forget what to do to fix it. 

Still, it doesn't fix the issue where this monitor loses connectivity with my Dell dock requiring me to pull the cable out and switch display ports. That happens 3-6x a day.

I'll never buy another ASUS monitor again.
