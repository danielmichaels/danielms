# I miss being a sniper sometimes

> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvvBqcWNW_s

I don't watch much of this stuff any more but they got with that thumbnail!

Some times I do miss that life. Honing your craft, really getting good at something. Pushing the limits
and being relied upon to make decisions that matter.

Also having an absolute blast doing it too!

Being paid to become world class at long range shooting isn't normal. I need to remember I lived a life
that was abnormal - did a job that was a lifestyle and all consuming.

That time is over but geez it's hard not to miss the **good** parts.

Also so good to see Nightforce absolutely dominating - I think I saw a Leupold once the rest were NF's.
