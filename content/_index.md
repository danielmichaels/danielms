# Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dan, software developer, creator and blogger. I am an ex-SF soldier who made the switch to software and is trying to navigate this world one day at a time. I work for a large corporation during the day and create stuff at night.

This is where I catalogue what I've done - from insignificant wins to big changes that have shaped who I am. I write about my new ventures and experiences. Sometimes I'll write about my past life too - some people find that interesting.
