# Summary

Launched [Mudmap]'s landing page and blog! So far its been going very minor traffic but that is okay - it is still in development. I did however get an email from a potential client asking to join in a beta in the meantime. That sort of feedback really fuels the fire and has me working hard to get the MVP out the door as fast as reasonably possible.

## Highlights

- Deployed [Mudmap]'s landing page!
- Started the implementation of a React frontend for the application.

## Goal Performance

Each month I write up how I went in the pursuit of last month's goals. It is
also somewhere I can expand on the things I've done. Helpful for historical
review and analysis.

### Finish the copywriting on mudmapâ€™s landing page

- **Appraisal**: Deployed the entire landing page!
- **Rating**: A+

The copy is not perfect and I will need to refine it continually but it is out there and getting read by potential customers.

I had originally written all of the copy in Django templates and it seemed to take a lot longer, and be more prone to ugliness than I was happy with. Most of this is due to my lack of design skills. Nonetheless, I started a quick google for some Hugo themes and found a great one that suited my style.

Within 48 hours, I had cloned the theme repo, created my own `website` repo and deployed it to Netlify. It is now being indexed by google and something I can work with to produce content that might attract more users in the future.

I listened to a podcast that featured Pierre De Wulf of [ScarpingBee.com][scrapingbee] and was inspired by his past experience running a SaaS business that failed. He was able to sell it because it was generating a lot of traffic. Pierre, said that their content marketing was what made it sellable.

It made me relize that everything that holds value is an asset, and valuable things can be created anywhere and from the seemingly inconsequential. That's why I launched the site prematurely, its a way to start raising awareness, keep me motivated and perfect my craft while no one really cares.

### Integrate Stripe as the payment processor

- **Appraisal**: Abandoned it for now as I am ripping out templates and replacing them with a React and Django SPA for the dashboard
- **Rating**: F

I spent a lot of time on this, and it was one of those *nail in the coffin* moments for the template system. I was getting frustrated with all the inline javascript in [Mudmap] already and it was made worse with Stripe. Not Stripe's fault, just the way it has to be.

So, in a way this **F** score has actually been a blessing - part of the reason I never look back on things with regret, only as a learning oppurtunity. This helped set me down the path of React for the dashboard, and once I knocked out a quick Proof-of-Concept I knew that it was *the* way forward for the sort of user experience I need to offer my future users.

Stripe seems to have a really good React package as well which will hopefully made the integration (hopefully this month - April) much easier.

### Write a blog post for danielms and [Mudmap]

- **Appraisal**: I wrote [Mudmap]'s first blog post but did not write one for this blog. I have been prioritising [Mudmap] and with so little time between that, family and my day job, something has to give.
- **Rating**: B

I like writing. But, I also like making things, and the fire under my feet to deliver [Mudmap] is so strong right now. The only things I will not budge on are my monthly Retro's and weekly [WhatGotDone]'s. 

However, I did produce a [blog for Mudmap][blog]. It explains the rough genesis and intent of [Mudmap] and is a bit of taste of blog deployment for me too. 

In the future, blog post's need to follow a deployment flow. The flow might look something like:

1. Write and deploy to the site
2. Send out newsletter to subscribers to let them know
3. Send a Twitter post from the [Mudmap Twitter][mm_twitter] account

At the moment it is all very manual which will lead to problems in the future. How I automate this, I am not sure just yet but possibly via a GitHub action workflow.

## Recommendations

I found [KneesOverToesGuy][kotg] the other day. 

## Wrap up

**What can I do better?**

- Research topics before getting straight into coding, for example, I was going to integrate Auth0 when I already have 90% of session authentication already handled
- Set Twitter boundaries, and use that *scroll* time for development of ideas instead

**What have I done well?**

- Deployed the landing page (without fear of *what people think*)
- Be open about my past work history online - something for years I have hidden away
- Managed my time between Mudmap and my family

## Next months goals

- Deploy Mudmap's application for beta testing
