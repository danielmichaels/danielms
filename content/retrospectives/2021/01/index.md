# Summary

Thought of a potential business create and its target market.

## Highlights

- Purchased a domain; [mudmap.io](https://mudmap.io)
- Created the proof of concept backend code
- Researched the domain for market fit, competition and general sense of
  whether its viable

## Goal Performance

Given this is my first retro, no goals were set last month. So I will talk to
the product and highlights above.

### Finding a product to create

Late last year, I discovered a niche in something I have found annoying in the
past; managing multiple *pfSense* firewalls. This usually means logging in to
each device one at a time using either SSH or a VPN. Its laborious and I hated
it.

Then I found a few custom API's that interface with *pfSense*. This meant I
could now make remote calls to each device and script my tasks. Anything that
can be scripted can also be turned into a web application, and thus the idea 
of [mudmap] was born.

Before I started writing any code, I did some research to see if the idea was
viable, or needed. I must admit it did take me too long to find one of the
competitors in this space. Originally, [mudmap] was going to be called *pfmon*
but [pfmonitor] already exists. The naming similarities are just too close for
me to be comfortable with, even though I still really like the name.

I asked questions on Reddit, searched *pfSense*'s own forums and even poked
around on Twitter.

A crude summary from a Reddit [post]:

> I can't upvote this enough. I love pfSense and consider it top of the stack, but there are so many options who offer central management and that makes it tough to recommend it to customers.

It's pretty much this mentality that makes me feel this product is viable. 
Time will tell

## Recommendations

If you live in Australia, or want to travel to Australia checkout [Newcastle].
I used to live there but moved away to take a job and I miss it. I was there
over Australia Day and its just magical. For a West Australian to say that an
east coast beach is brilliant is a big deal; west coast beaches are on a whole
unequivocally better.

## Wrap up

**What can I do better?**

- Catalogue my research, particularly product market and feasibility information into notion for future reference

**What have I done well?**

- Started on the path from worker to creator. I follow [dvassallo]'s school of thought here; optimize life over money. 

## Next months goals

- Add a blog to [mudmap]
- Complete PoC of [mudmap] backend; API install, account creation, device registration, view properties
- Gain 5 twitter followers
