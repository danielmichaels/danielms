This is a list of software, tools, and stuff that I use on a regular basis.

## Development

### Editors

- **GoLand** - I write a lot of Go
- **PyCharm** - I used to write a lot of Python
- **Webstorm** - I write typescript because I have to
- [Zed](https://zed.dev) for light scripting/reading code 
- **NeoVim** or just Vim for everything else

### Terminal & Shell

- [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org) - For my Mac
- [WezTerm](https://wezterm.org/index.html) - On Linux
- [ddterm](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3780/ddterm) - Dropdown terminal for linux
- [Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) with Oh My Zsh - Shell with useful plugins
- [Starship](https://ohmyz.sh) cross-shell prompt
- [zellij](https://zellij.dev) a better TMUX experience

### Development Tools

- [task](https://task.dev) a better `makefile`. Use it in every project.
- [chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io) for managing dotfiles, scripts and more across machines backed by git
- [arkade](https://github.com/alexellis/arkade) easily install kubernetes tools (useful more so on Linux as `brew` is pretty good)
- [curlie](https://github.com/rs/curlie) I alias this to `curl` as its a dropline replacement with better defaults
- [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) for when I'm not using JetBrains in built git tools
- [k9s](https://k9scli.io); I can't use `kubectl` anymore

## System & Productivity

### Operating System

- **MacOS** - Macbook M4 Pro
  - Only recently started using this. Mac's are a lot better since my last one in around 2015-16 ish.
- **Ubuntu** - Linux desktop
  - Simple, just works. Containers as a native construct is far superior to all MacOS workarounds.

### Productivity and General Apps

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) - Note-taking and knowledge management. Pay for cloud sync.
- [Remarkable2](https://remarkable.com/products/remarkable-2) - All my rough work, notes, sketches start in here before
  transcribing to Obsidian. Pay for cloud.
- [Zet](https://github.com/danielmichaels/zet-cmd) - My personal zettlekasten CLI which gets published to this site
- [raycast](https://www.raycast.com) if you aren't using this on Mac what is wrong with you! Its amazing
- [bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) Password Vault. I pay for premium at $10 USD a year; it's a steal

## Hosting & Services

### Hosting

- [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com) Any time I need a VPS that doesn't need to be in my geo
- [Coolify](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify) Self-hosted application platform
- [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en) - VM hypervisor for my home lab

### Networking

- [pfSense](https://pfsense.com) firewall
- [unifi](https://ui.com) I use their switches and access points. They're the Apple of networking
